# Wikidot Bundle Comments

## Infininight - 2009-02-08

* Header commands should not override âŒ˜1-5.
	* Is that a hard rule? writing html and headings are very common - making them a multi-key command decreases utility
* Are 'Ordered List Item' and 'Unordered Item' supposed to have tab triggers? Seems odd.
	* makes for consistency and memorability across different markup languages: I wish all the markups did this.
* Any reason you started the comment preferences at 3 rather than 1?
	* Changed to 1 now: Was just copying another language and then playing to get it working
* Seems to be an error in the syntax document starting at 'Image Gallery'.
	* That looked (and previewed fine to me)?
* Link commands should be be removed in favor of the Hyperlink Helper bundle where possible.
	* I've emailed a pref to handle generic links out of Hyperlink Helper
	* Hyperlink helper doesn't allow different link types, but in wikidot, a wikipedia link is built-in as [wikipedia:topic]
	* Internal links (link to the same site as the caller) are [[[wrapped in triple brackets]]]. That should stay in the wikidot bundle
* meta.separator should end in \n? to better scope the caret.
	* done 
* markup.raw.wikidot should end in \n? to better scope the caret.
	* done
